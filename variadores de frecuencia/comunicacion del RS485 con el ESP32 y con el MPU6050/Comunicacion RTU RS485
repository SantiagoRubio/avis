RS485 MODBUS-RTU Rev. 1.2 – 25/09/2012
SETTING THE RS485 COMMUNICATION PARAMETERS OF THE TRANSMITTER WITH A
STANDARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM
Before connecting the transmitter to the RS485 network, an address must be assigned
and the communication parameters be set, if different from the factory preset.
The parameters setting is performed as follows:
• If you have the RS48 cable, install the drivers in the PC.
• Connect the transmitter to a PC USB port using the cable RS48 (or alternatively
through another USB/RS485 converter available, ensuring that their drivers are
installed in the PC).
• Move the ADDRESS jumper between the sign "ADDRESS" and "N = 0" to select
the configuration mode (see technical sheet to locate the jumper).
• Start a communication program such as Hyperterminal, and set the serial
communication parameters as follows (the instrument is connected to a COM port
type):
Baud rate: 115200
Parity: None
Data Bits: 8
Stop Bits: 2
• Send the serial commands given in the following table to set the RS485 MODBUS
parameters:
Command Response Description
MA nnn & Set RS485 address
Ranging from 1 to 247
Preset on 1
MB n & Set RS485 Baud Rate
n=0 ⇒ 9600
n=1 ⇒ 19200
Preset on 1 ⇒ 19200
MP n & Set RS485 transmission mode
n=0 ⇒ 8-N-1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit)
n=1 ⇒ 8-N-2 (8 data bits, no parity, 2 stop bits)
n=2 ⇒ 8-E-1 (8 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit)
n=3 ⇒ 8-E-2 (8 data bits, even parity, 2 stop bits)
n=4 ⇒ 8-O-1 (8 data bits, odd parity, 1 stop bit)
n=5 ⇒ 8-O-2 (8 data bits, odd parity, 2 stop bits)
Preset on 2 ⇒ 8-E-1
MW n & Set receiving mode after RS485 transmission
n=0 ⇒ Violates the protocol and gets in listen mode
immediately after the transmission
n=1 ⇒ Respects the protocol and waits 3.5 characters
after the transmission
Preset on 1 ⇒ Respects the protocol
- 2 -
• You can check the parameters setting and read the information of the instrument
by sending the following serial commands:
Command Response Description
G0 Transmitter Model
G2 Serial number of the transmitter
G3 Firmware Version
G4 Firmware Date
L1 Address Read RS485 address
L2 Baud Rate
(0,1)
Read RS485 Baud Rate
0 ⇒ 9600
1 ⇒ 19200
L3 Tx Mode
(0,1,2,3,4,5)
Read RS485 transmission mode
0 ⇒ 8-N-1
1 ⇒ 8-N-2
2 ⇒ 8-E-1
3 ⇒ 8-E-2
4 ⇒ 8-O-1
5 ⇒ 8-O-2
L4 Rx Mode
(0,1)
Read receiving mode after RS485 transmission
0 ⇒ Violates the protocol and gets in listen mode
immediately after Tx
1 ⇒ Respects the protocol and waits 3.5 characters after
Tx
P0 & Ping
• When finished, reposition the ADDRESS jumper between the indications
"ADDRESS" and "N =" to restore the MODBUS mode.
READING OF THE MEASURES WITH THE MODBUS-RTU PROTOCOL WHEN THE
INSTRUMENT IS IN OPERATING CONDITIONS (INSTALLED IN A NETWORK)
In MODBUS mode, you can read the values measured by the instrument through the
function code 04h (Read Input Registers). The following table lists the quantities
available with the appropriate register address:
Address Quantity Format
0 Temperature in °C (x10) 16-bit Integer
1 Temperature in °F (x10) 16 bit Integer
2 Relative Humidity in % (x10) 16-bit Integer
3 Dew Point in °C (x10) 16 bit Integer
4 Dew Point in °F (x10) 16-bit Integer
5 Status register
bit 0 = 1 ⇒ temperature measurement error
bit 1 = 1 ⇒ humidity measurement error
bit 2 = 1 ⇒ dew point calculation error
bit 3 = 1 ⇒ configuration data error
16-bit Integer
